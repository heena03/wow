    <h1> Inspiring Stories Of The Pioneers Of The Fashion Industry:</h1>
</header>
<body>
    <h2>1. Prada:</h2>
    <p>Miuccia Prada is regarded as one of the most influential and enigmatic fashion designers of modern times.
         She has transformed a small house business into one of the most impressive multi-billion dollar fashion houses.
         
      Miuccia is a true iconoclast and someone who has never ducked a challenge. Under her direction, the Prada brand has managed
       to amalgamate the old and the new, the ugly and the sublime, the vulgar and the simple, to show off various original and 
       often unexpected ideas. In fact, no two collections have ever looked vaguely the same. The Prada renaissance started under
        Miuccia in 1985 with unassuming fabric for her bags. Miuccia chose function over fashion. The brand’s nylon 
        bags eventually became a symbol of modernity, allowing luxury to be subversive and beyond the superficial.</p>
        <h3>2. Vivienne Westwood:</h3>
        <img src="d.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px">
        <p>Vivienne Westwood is perhaps the most influential British designer the world has ever seen. In an industry 
            predominantly created to showcase beauty, Vivienne uses her skills to advocate higher causes through her passion 
            for art, history and social justice. In doing so, she redefined what being a designer could represent, inspiring a 
            wave of other designers to use fashion as a means of sparkling cultural change. Westwood was responsible for bringing the 
            entire punk movement into British fashion. She can be adequately described as a rebel when it comes to fashion.</p>
       <h4>3. Alexander McQueen:</h4>
       <p>One only needed to look at the nature of Alexander McQueen’s 
        work, the inherent violence and melancholy in every piece, to see 
        there was a deep and permeable wound at the core of this young designer. 
        McQueen, who passed away in 2010, continues to be regarded as an iconic figure in British fashion
        . Despite his humble beginnings, McQueen’s
         hard work made him rise to head the fashion brand 
         Givenchy when he was only 27.</p>
          
         <h5>4. Vera Wang:</h5>
         <p>Vera Wan has continued to challenge herself as a creator even today when she has completed almost 31 years in the fashion industry. She firmly asserts that it is only her personal learning curve and growth as a human being and not just as a designer that has given her the reason to study and learn even more. An accomplished competitive figure skater, Wang uses similar exactitude in her fashion designs. She worked at Conde Nast for 16 years, which consisted of everything remarkable such as assisting Polly Mellen, a former stylist and a fashion editor. She also carried out projects for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and worked on sittings. During her 16-year long tenure, a famous photographer, impressed by her work, casually mentioned that she is cut out to be the editor. So, she moved on to actually become the editor of Conde Nast. After working as an accessories designer for three years under another famous name, Ralph Lauren, she moved on to create the famous brand that she now owns.</p>
          <h6>7. Balenciaga:</h6>
          <img src="d1.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px">
          <p>Cristóbal Balenciaga belongs to the class of those prodigies of fashion who never received formal training in terms of art school or fashion design, but still moved on to make a name for himself. Balenciaga has always specialized in exquisitely tailored clothing and formal wear. The brand had a change of direction and now probably has a collection popularized as the ‘American street fashion’. It has some pretty quirky products to boast off, including shoes that look like socks and big bold quirky prints that have become increasingly popular with the brand’s fans.</p>
          <h2>10. Giorgio Armani:</h2>
          <img src="d2.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px">
          <p>Italian designer Giorgio Armani is mostly known for sleek designer suits that he creates for men and women alike. Armani, known for what is called the “power suits” because they exude confidence, has been the designer for many famous people, including John Travolta, Jodie Foster, Richard Gere, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others. Armani was also the costume designer on the sets of the film Miami Vice. Armani extended his fashion collection to include more ready-to-wear dresses, and formal and evening wear.</p>
          <p>And many more...</p>
